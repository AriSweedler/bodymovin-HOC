This code is meant to take bodymovin (JSON) files and place them in a React "Higher Order Component" (HOC)

This way, when we create JSON files from After Effects & bodymovin, we can use this code to easily place it into our web app.
When we have our animations stored as a HOC, we'll be able to manipulate them much more easily.
